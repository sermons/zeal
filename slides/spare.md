## 1 Cor 3:16-17 <span class="ref">(NIV)</span>
Don’t you know that you **yourselves** <br/>
are God’s **temple** <br/>
and that God’s **Spirit** dwells in your midst?

If anyone **destroys** God’s temple, <br/>
**God** will destroy that person;

for God’s temple is **sacred**, <br/>
and **you together** are that temple.
