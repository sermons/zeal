When it was almost time <br/>
for the Jewish **Passover**, <br/>
Jesus went up to **Jerusalem**.

<span class="ref">14</span>
In the **temple courts** he found <br/>
people selling **cattle**, **sheep** and **doves**, <br/>
and others sitting at **tables** <br/>
exchanging **money**.

---
<span class="ref">15</span>
So he made a **whip** out of cords, <br/>
and **drove** all from the temple courts, <br/>
both **sheep** and **cattle**;

he **scattered** the coins of the money changers <br/>
and **overturned** their tables.

---
<span class="ref">16</span>
To those who **sold** doves he said, <br/>
“Get these **out of here**! <br/>
Stop turning **my Father’s house** into a **market**!”

<span class="ref">17</span>
His disciples **remembered** that it is written: <br/>
“**Zeal** for your **house** will **consume** me.”

---
<span class="ref">18</span>
The Jews then **responded** to him, <br/>
“What **sign** can you show us <br/>
to **prove** your authority to do all this?”

<span class="ref">19</span>
Jesus answered them, <br/>
“Destroy this **temple**, <br/>
and I will **raise** it again in three days.”

---
<span class="ref">20</span>
They replied, “It has taken <br/>
**forty-six years** to build this temple, <br/>
and you are going to raise it in **three days**?”

<span class="ref">21</span>
But the **temple** he had spoken of <br/>
was his **body**.

---
<span class="ref">22</span>
**After** he was raised from the dead, <br/>
his disciples **recalled** what he had said.

Then they **believed** the **Scripture** <br/>
and the **words** that Jesus had spoken.
