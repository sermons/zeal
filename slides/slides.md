<div class="ref">13</div>
When it was almost time <br/>
for the Jewish Passover, <br/>
Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

<div class="ref">14</div>
In the temple courts he found <br/>
people selling cattle, sheep and doves, <br/>
and others sitting at tables <br/>
exchanging money.

---
<div class="ref">15</div>
So he made a whip out of cords, <br/>
and drove all from the temple courts, <br/>
both sheep and cattle;

he scattered the coins of the money changers <br/>
and overturned their tables.

---
<div class="ref">16</div>
To those who sold doves he said, <br/>
“Get these out of here! <br/>
Stop turning my Father’s house into a market!”

<div class="ref">17</div>
His disciples remembered that it is written: <br/>
“Zeal for your house will consume me.”

---
<div class="ref">18</div>
The Jews then responded to him, <br/>
“What sign can you show us <br/>
to prove your authority to do all this?”

<div class="ref">19</div>
Jesus answered them, <br/>
“Destroy this temple, <br/>
and I will raise it again in three days.”

---
<div class="ref">20</div>
They replied, “It has taken <br/>
forty-six years to build this temple, <br/>
and you are going to raise it in three days?”

<div class="ref">21</div>
But the temple he had spoken of was his body.

---
<div class="ref">22</div>
After he was raised from the dead, <br/>
his disciples recalled what he had said.

Then they believed the scripture <br/>
and the words that Jesus had spoken.
